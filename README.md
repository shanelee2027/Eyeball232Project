Eye doctors rely on visual appraisal to identify a host of ocular diseases. This paper seeks to use the Ocular Disease Recognition dataset from Kaggle in order to classify medical conditions using image data. By using SVD, PCA, and Laplacian Eigenmaps, we perform dimension reduction techniques to examine the usability of this dataset. From our analysis, we reveal that there are patterns and features that correctly classify ocular images for medical conditions, but the eye images alone are not sufficient for classification.
